# WeatherApp
This app is in process... I'm building a Mobile Weather App for my portfolio using React Native &amp; Expo.  Will ultimately be published to Google/Play store.  It's a simple one page app.
- Has autocomplete search function
- Displays current weather and forecasted weather for any city.
- Uses Tailwind for styling
- Stores the users city of choice on the device's local storage.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- Download Expo for your IOS or Android phone: [Visit Expo](https://expo.io/)

## Getting Started

You will need to create a .env file in the projects root folder with your own API_KEY from www.weatherapi.com

In the terminal type: 
 - npm install
 - npm start

You can scan the QR code with the Expo app on your mobile device to open the project.

## Project Structure
The project structure follows the standard structure of a React Native Expo project. Here are some key directories and files:

- App.js: The entry point of the application.
- assets/: Stores static assets such as images, fonts, etc.
- components/: Contains reusable components used throughout the application.
- screens/: Contains the individual screens/pages of the application.
- utils/: For storage to local device

Feel free to explore the code and make any necessary modifications to suit your needs.
